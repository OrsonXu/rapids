Histogram of valid sensed hours
===============================

This histogram shows the valid sensed hours of all participants processed in RAPIDS (See valid sensed :ref:`bins<phone-valid-sensed-bins>` and :ref:`days<phone-valid-sensed-days>` sections). It can be used as a rough indication of the AWARE client monitoring coverage during a study for all participants.
