Overall compliance heatmap
==========================

In this heatmap rows are participants, columns are days and cellsâ€™ color shows the valid sensed hours for a participant during a day (See valid sensed :ref:`bins<phone-valid-sensed-bins>` and :ref:`days<phone-valid-sensed-days>` sections). This plot can be configured to show a certain number of days before today using the ``EXPECTED_NUM_OF_DAYS`` parameter (by default -1 showing all days for every participant). As different participants might join the study on different dates, the x-axis has a day index instead of a date. This plot gives the user a quick overview of the amount of data collected per person and is complementary to the histogram of valid sensed hours as it is broken down per participant and per day.
