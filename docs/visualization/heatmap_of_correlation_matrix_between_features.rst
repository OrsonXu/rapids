Heatmap of correlation matrix between features
==============================================

Columns and rows are features computed in RAPIDS, cellsâ€™ color represents the correlation coefficient between all days of data for every pair of feature of all participants. The user can specify a minimum number of observations required to compute the correlation between two features using the ``MIN_ROWS_RATIO`` parameter (0.5 by default). In addition, this plot can be configured to only display correlation coefficients above a threshold using the ``CORR_THRESHOLD`` parameter (0.1 by default).
