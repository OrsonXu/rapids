**Parameters of heatmap_features_correlations Rule:**

=======================    ==============
Name                       Description
=======================    ==============
plot                       Whether the rule is executed or not. The available options are ``True`` and ``False``.
min_valid_hours_per_day    The minimum valid hours per day.
min_valid_bins_per_hour    The minimum valid bins per hour.
corr_method                Method of correlation. The available options are ``pearson``, ``kendall`` and ``spearman``.
min_rows_ratio             Minimum number of observations required per pair of columns to have a valid correlation coefient. Currently, only available for ``pearson`` and ``spearman`` correlation.
phone_features             The list of phone features.
fitbit_features            The list of Fitbit features.
corr_threshold             Only correlation coefficients larger than ``corr_threshold`` can be shown in the heatmap.
=======================    ==============

**Observations:**

Columns and rows are features computed in RAPIDS, cellsâ€™ color represents the correlation coefficient between all days of data for every pair of feature of all participants. The user can specify a minimum number of observations required to compute the correlation between two features using the ``MIN_ROWS_RATIO`` parameter (0.5 by default). In addition, this plot can be configured to only display correlation coefficients above a threshold using the ``CORR_THRESHOLD`` parameter (0.1 by default). See Figure 5.
