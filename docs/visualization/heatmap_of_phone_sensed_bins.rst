Heatmap of phone sensed bins
============================

In this heatmap rows are dates, columns are sensed bins for a participant, and cellsâ€™ color shows the number of mobile sensors that logged at least one row of data during that bin. This plot shows the periods of time without data for a participant and can be used as a rough indication of whether time-based sensors were following their sensing schedule (e.g. if location was being sensed every 2 minutes).
