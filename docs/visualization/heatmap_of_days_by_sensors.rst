Heatmap of days by sensors
==========================

In this heatmap rows are sensors, columns are days and cellsâ€™ color shows the normalized (0 to 1) number of valid sensed hours (See valid sensed :ref:`bins<phone-valid-sensed-bins>` and :ref:`days<phone-valid-sensed-days>` sections) collected by a sensor during a day for a participant. The user can decide how many days of data to show starting from the first day of each participant. This plot can used to judge missing data on a per participant, per sensor basis as well as the number of valid sensed hours (usable data) for each day.
